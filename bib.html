		<p>Dio gives the impression that the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra was heavily weighted in Cleopatra&apos;s favour when it came to 
		equality. The relationship was more like slave and master as <q cite='#bib01'>she had&hellip;enslaved him</q> and was <q cite='#bib01'>saluted by him as &#145;queen&#146; 
		and &#145;mistress&#146;</q> (Dio, in AA100 Assignment Booklet, 2010, p.18). She went everywhere with him, and whilst she was either on horseback or 
		<q cite='#bib01'>carried in a litter</q> (line 20), Antony was reduced to following <q cite='#bib01'>on foot together with her eunuchs</q> (lines 21-22). This 
		is hardly the position of an equal and is particularly degrading and emasculating for a man of Antony&apos;s stature, especially a Roman.</p>
		<p>When the sculptors represent Antony as Osiris or Dionysus, gods of death and renewal, this indicates the death of the old Roman Antony and 
		the birth of the new Egyptianised Antony. Coupled with Cleopatra depicted as Selene or Isis, goddesses of fertility, she provides the 
		nutrients in which the renewed Antony can grow and flourish. Again this hints at Cleopatra being the one in charge and leading Antony, 
		enchanting him <q cite='#bib01'>under some spell</q> (line 28) and depriving him of his wits.</p>
		<p>This same impression is prevalent in other accounts of the time in other Roman sources. When Octavian gives a speech to his army before 
		the battle of Actium, he remarks <q cite='#bib02'>who would not groan at hearing that Roman knights and senators grovel before her (Cleopatra) like 
		eunuchs?</q> (Scott-Kilvert, 1987, in Fear, 2010, p.27). It&apos;s interesting to see Antony again being associated with the emasculated 
		eunuchs. Octavian continues to say that Antony is <q cite='#bib02'>being enslaved by her</q> (lines 20-21), underlining the master/slave relationship between 
		the two.</p>
		<p>Even when Cleopatra first meets Antony after ignoring several summons, again showing her self-perceived higher status of herself, she 
		treats him with contempt. Arriving in a barge <q cite='#bib03'>with a poop of gold, its purple sails billowing in the wind</q> (Scott-Kilvert, 1965, 
		in Fear, 2010, p.10), Cleopatra upstages and in a way, humiliates, Antony, gradually drawing the crowds to see her arrival, and leaving 
		Antony alone (lines 39-40). Horace in his Ode (West, 2004, in Fear, 2010, p.28) speaks of <q  cite='#bib04'>the mad queen with her contaminated flock of 
		men</q>, one of which is Antony, again accentuating the poisoned chalice of her company.</p>
		<p>Dio also mentions that Cleopatra <q cite='#bib01'>came to entertain the hope that she would rule the Romans</q> (Dio, in AA100 Assignment Booklet, 
		2010, p.18). This displays her naked ambition for power, and also suggests that she was using Antony as a means to this end. In ancient Rome 
		this would have been unheard of, as there was no place for women in politics and <q cite='#bib03'>the idea of a female head of state was abhorrent</q>
		(Fear, 2010, p.13).</p>
		<p>One must remember in all this that the victors write history, and Cleopatra lost, and therefore a lot of Roman spin was put on everything that 
		was written about her.</p> -->
