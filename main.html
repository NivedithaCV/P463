        <p>Before the study of exoplanets our solar system was
           the only source of data for the study of planet formation and evolution. The geometry and property of planets were inferred only 
           from the eight planets orbiting the sun. From these planets the planetary orientations, physical and chemical properties and 
           characteristics of orbits were studied. The similarities within these eight planets helped in formulating theories on the formation 
           of the solar system. But the question of whether certain properties or phenomena that were observed in our solar system was caused 
           by the laws of physics or randomness was not able to be answered before a few decades, as there were no other planetary systems. 
           When a planet was discovered orbiting the Sun-like star 51 Pegasi in the 1990s, these and many other puzzles began to be answered.
           Astronomers and the general public have grown more and more interested in finding and characterizing exoplanets, and this accelerated
            after the launch of the Kepler spacecraft in 2009. And other more initiatives have been conducted over the past ten years to collect
             information that might eventually result in the discovery of more exoplanets. Presently there are more than 5000 confirmed 
             exoplanets that were able to be detected and these exoplanets have varying properties, they have different masses, sizes, orbital 
             periods and also the stars they orbit are of different types.For the understanding of planet distribution and the formation pattern
              Kepler mission has a major hand . It was able to give a large number of planet dataset from which patterns can be identified to 
              stimulate and test theories. The work that has been done to improve these data like understanding the Kepler dataset pipeline for
          looking at the detection efficiency and studies from the Kepler follow-up program has increased the reliability of the statistical
           inferences made. The major works in statistical study have been given in the Win and Fabrichy (2015) and Zhu and Dong (2021) .

        <h2>Methods</h2>

        <p>The first inference from the data that can be obtained  using statistics is the occurrence rate of 
          the planets that gives how many planets were detected to the observed stars.  The occurrence rate is 
          given as,
        </p>
        $$n_p= \frac{N_{tp}}{N_{ts}}$$
        
        <p>
          where N<sub>tp</sub> is the Total number of planets and N<sub>
            ts </sub> the total number of stars. The planets will be sampled in a parameter space that can differ. The fraction of the number of stars to the number of planets is given by, 
            $$F_p = \frac{Total\:of\:planetary\:systems}{total\:of\:stars}  $$
            \(n_p\) and \(F_p\) will be referred from here as the frequency 
            of planets and frequency of the planetary systems to clear any confusions.
            The ratio of these terms i.e, fraction of total number of planets to the planetary system gives the multiplicity
            For calculating the occurrence rate the likelihood based method is used, this is a probabilistically motivated method where the model is based on Poisson distribution by taking into account that the probability of observation depends upon the transit probability and the efficiency of the detection. The estimator of the frequency is, 
            $$n_p = \frac{N_p}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_*}p_j}$$  
            $$ = \frac{N_p}{N_*} \frac{1}{|p|}$$
             $$  = \frac{N_p}{N_*^{eff}} $$

             The constant \(p_j\) denotes the planetary detection efficiency for the \(j^{th}\) star. As the detection effeciency can deviate and flactuate this is taken care in the equation as it is averaged over the detection efficincy.
             Using a simplified bayesian  model this can be calculated using the likelihood of the planet detection as Gamma distribution.
             The constant \(\alpha_0\) and \(\beta_0\) taken as the shape parametr and rate parameter.
             The statistical sample is given by, 
             $$P(\tilde{n_p}|N_p,N_*^{eff})\propto n_p^{\alpha_0 +N_p -1}e^{-n_p(\beta_0 + N_*^{eff})} $$ .
             This is used in the study for calculating frequency of planet in the period-radius parameter plane.
             Sample for the statistic analysis was taken from the Kepler mission. In this sample the planets having a radius in the range from the jupyter to earth and period of 1 year is available.
             In the data cleaning process the data with signal to noise ratio below 7.0 , those planets which is marked as false positive, 
             the planets with radius less than 20 times radius of earth, P greater than 700 days and impact parameter greater than 1 has been removed. the final sample size of the 
             planet distribution is 2,525.
            </p>
        <p>One of the discoveries in the planet statistics is 
          the radius valley; it shows a decrease in the 
          detection of the planet in the radius plane 
          separating the super Earth and the sub Neptune. 
          The theories that are used to explain the radius
           valley are photoevaporation which could have driven the mass loss  and core-powered mass 
           loss but these theories are not without flaws.  
           This is visible in the Kepler survey dine in 
            Zhu and Dong (2021). The dependence of the radius 
            valley to the orbital period and stellar mass has 
            been parameterized as, 
            $$\frac{R_p}{R_p^{valley}}= (\frac{P}{10 days}^g)(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot})^b $$</p>
        <h2> Results and discussion</h2>
        <h3> Occurence rate:</h3>

            <figcaption>Fig 1:The planet distribution in period-radius plane. The different symbols as shown in legend represent the detection method of the planet.
              The dashed line shows the radius of jupiter and radius of neptune. the grey solid line shows the median efficiency of planet detection.  </figcaption>
          </Fig:3>
        </p>
         
        <p>
          The period radius plane is made to grid with each cell being equally spaced in logarithmic scale. The average detection efficiency is calculated as,
          $$ &lt; p &gt; =\frac{ \int_{R_{p,min}}^{R_{p,max}} \int_{P_{min}}{P_{max}}(\frac{R_\odot}{a} S(P,R_p)dlnPdlnR_p}
          {\int_{R_{p,min}}^{R_{p,max}}dlnPdlnR_p}$$
          \(S(P,R_p)\) is for a perticular period and radius the sensitivity introduced by survey detection thresholds.
          The grid cells are defined by the \(R_{p,min},R_{p,max},P_{min},P_{max}\) and the probability of the transit is calculated using the \(a\), semimajor axis using \(R_\odot /a\)
          The planet frequency og each cell is given in Fig 2. It shows the hot jupiter cell group
          and hot Neptune cells desert and planets with very short period is outlined with dashed red lines. The number shows the planets frequency within that cell
          with their error bar given the fraction is multiplicity.

          <figcaption>Fig 2: The planet frequency and multiplicity mapped in the grid.</figcaption>
        </Fig:3>
        <p> It can be seen in the frequency map that the planets with radius less than \(4R_\bigoplus\)
          is present in the orbital period of less than 400 days. The trend of the frequency is greates in large radius
           and small orbital period and the smallest in small radius and large orbital period cells.
           This trend is disrupted in the radius valley. The planets are seen to be present in multiplanet system in the planetary systems surveyed by the Kepler.

         <h3>Radius valley:</h3>
           
          <Fig:2>
          <a href="plot1.webp" target="_blank">
          <img width="520" src="plot1.webp"></img>
        </a>
          <figcaption>Fig 3: The radius distribution in the radius valley region </figcaption>
        </Fig:2>
        
        <p>
        
          The radius valley that is found in the taken sample is shown in Fig 2
        The values of the constants are taken for planets in the radius 1 to
         4\(R_\bigoplus\) and the
         period as 3 to 30 days. The radius valley is then found in the rescaled value of the radius . 
         $$\tilde{R_p} = R_p(\frac{P}{10days})^{-g}(M_*/M_\odot)^{-b}$$
         The Fig:2 a plot 
        shows the rescaled radius with the planets within the box used for the radius distribution.
         the plot Fig 2.b shows the number of 
        planets for the rescaled radius and
         the gray band shows the dip in the distribution. It can be senn that the
         number of planets in the sub earth size is not decreasing and this could suggest
         more exoplanet in this parameter space yet to be discovered. The result cannot produce any good prrof of which theory 
         explains the radius valley the best. Composition constrain are inferred from this region of the radius distribution
         with the mass-radius measurement of these plants which tells that smaller have dense cores and these could aquire gasous envelope of few thickness.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The study of exoplanet statistics is paving way in understanding and formulating theories on the planet formation, evolution and their distribution. Through the review of literature and results published recently the new constraints on the theory and limitations of the study was explored. The occurrence rate was calculated using the Kepler mission database, some of the data that was ambiguous was removed and using bayesian statistics the frequency distribution of planets in the period-radius plane was mapped and analyzed. One of the areas of study for understanding the evolution of radius valley was examined using the sample.
